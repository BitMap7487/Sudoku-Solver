<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The program has a user- [x]friendly interface built using Windows Forms in C#. It allows users to interact with the Sudoku grid visually.
- [x] **Puzzle Generation:** The program can generate Sudoku puzzles by fetching data from an API or using a predefined template. Users have the option to load a random puzzle or start with an empty grid.
- [x] **Puzzle Solving:** The application uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It provides a Solve button that attempts to find a solution for the given puzzle.
- [x] **Input Validation:** The program validates user input to ensure that only valid numbers from 1 to 9 are entered in the Sudoku grid. It displays error messages for invalid input.
- [x] **Visual Representation:** The Sudoku grid is displayed using a table- [x]like structure with text boxes for each cell. Filled cells are shown with a dark gray background, while empty cells are displayed with a white background.
- [x] **Solution Display:** Once the puzzle is solved, the program displays the solved puzzle in the Sudoku grid, highlighting the solution cells.
